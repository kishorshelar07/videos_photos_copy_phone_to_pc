When transferring a large number of files from an Android phone to a PC, selecting too many files at once can lead to errors or system slowdowns due to overload. This Node.js script provides an automated solution to copy all files from your phone to your PC at once, eliminating the need for batch processing or looping. The script skips any files that have already been copied to avoid duplicates and automatically creates the destination folder if it doesnâ€™t exist. To use the script, simply clone or download the repository, modify the PHONE_STORAGE_PATH to point to your phone's storage or mapped drive, and set the DESTINATION_FOLDER to your desired location on the PC. After installing the required fs-extra module and ensuring Node.js is installed, you can run the script, and it will copy all files in one go. This process ensures efficient and complete transfers without system overload.
