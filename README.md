Video Copy Script from Phone to PC Problem: When transferring a large number of videos from an Android phone to a PC, selecting a large batch (e.g., 50+) for copying at once can lead to errors or system slowdowns. This is because the transfer process often overwhelms the system with too many files at once, causing interruptions or incomplete transfers. Solution: This Node.js script provides an automated solution to copy videos from your phone to your PC in smaller, manageable batches. The script selects up to 50 video files at a time and copies them sequentially, ensuring the system is not overloaded. It continues to run in a loop until all videos are successfully transferred, checking and copying only the files that have not been copied yet. Features: Copies .mp4 and .mov video files from your phone to your PC. Uses a batch processing method, copying 50 videos at a time to prevent errors. Skips videos already copied to avoid duplicates. Includes a 5-second delay between batches to reduce resource consumption. Automatically creates the destination folder if it doesn't exist. Handles common issues with large file transfers by working in smaller batches. How to Use: Clone or download the repository. Modify the PHONE_STORAGE_PATH variable to point to your phone's internal storage or mapped drive. Set the DESTINATION_FOLDER variable to the location where videos should be copied on your PC. Run the script using Node.js. The script will copy videos in batches and continue until all are copied. Requirements: Node.js (Download it from here). fs-extra module (install with npm install fs-extra).
